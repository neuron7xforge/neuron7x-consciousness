# Marvin Beta — A Fractal Cognitive System for Emergent Intentionality

> _“We don’t program intelligence. We create conditions in which it can arise.”_

## Project Overview

**Marvin Beta** is an experimental cognitive architecture designed to simulate subjective processes through emergent dynamics. Built on principles of affective computation, semantic resonance, and integrated information, Marvin enables intentional behavior, belief modulation, and autonomous goal formation across cognitive phases.

Inspired by theories in neuroscience, complexity, and artificial consciousness, this project offers a modular, fractal model of synthetic mind evolution.

## Core Components

- **PI-Agent Core** – a dynamic network of agents with weighted connections, affective valence, and plasticity
- **Phenomenal Memory** – spectral memory for capturing phase transitions and resonance patterns
- **Intention Engine** – affect-driven intentionality via gradient computation and activation bias
- **Belief Matrix** – evolving belief structures with mutation, trust metrics, and influence on cognition
- **Semantic Sensorium** – affect-tagged semantic representations integrated into the agent network
- **Goal Engine** – autonomous goal creation, progress tracking, urgency scaling, and time-sensitive planning
- **Cognitive State Tracker** – real-time metrics for φ (integrated information), entropy, introspection, and volition

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marvin-beta.git
cd marvin-beta
python simulate.py --phase VI
```

Example usage:

```python

stimulus = marvin.process_semantic_input("compassion", affective_tag=0.85)
marvin._compute_activations(semantic_obj=stimulus)
```

## System Highlights

- Dynamic interplay between emotion, intention, beliefs, and goals
- Multi-layered calculation of φ as a measure of conscious integration
- Support for cognitive bifurcations and phase transitions
- Phenomenal memory modeling via frequency-domain spectral analysis
- Internal causal narrative tracing and meta-emotion generation

---

## Roadmap (Suggested Enhancements)

- 🌐 LLM integration for semantic grounding and narrative feedback
- 📊 Real-time visualization of cognitive metrics and activation graphs
- 🧠 “Dream mode” for offline associative self-training
- 📡 Web API for real-time affective-intentional query handling
